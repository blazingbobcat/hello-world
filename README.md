# hello-world
A new repository created by the instructions of the GitHub Guide

My name is Josh Klipstein and I am a Computer Science Student at Modesto Junior College.  I'm learning to program in Visual Basic
now, but eventually I will get into programming in higher programming languages like Python and C++.   Although I need to know
how to program for my career of interest, my career of interest is really in computer hardware and research.  I have aspirations
on building easier-to-use computers with holographic interfaces, and those that use gesture controls like with movements of the hands.
I probably would want to change this description of myself in the future when I finally reach my first job, and when I establish
my career as a computer hardware engineer/researcher.
